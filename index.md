# Mikah's Awesome Website
## There are a lot of things I love about CS193! My favorites are:
```markdown
- The help with creating cool things like Github Websites!
- The Command Line commands discussed during class, particularly pwd!
- The funny pictures and animations in the slides!
- The energetic Professors!
```
 
 
 Imma just keep this stuff here for future reference:

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
